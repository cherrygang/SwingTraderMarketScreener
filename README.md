# Market Screener for swing trading on daily charts

This scans every ticker on the market, gets their last 12 months of volume history, and alerts you when the stock passes above the selected technical indicators.
By default the screener looks towards if the RSI has been below 30 for the last three days & if the 9 day Estimated Moving Average (EMA) crosses above the 20 day EMA within the last three days.

### How to run the script:
- Download your favorite Python IDE.
- Get my script from GitHub
- Open the script in your IDE and install all required dependancies by typing pip install -r requirements.txt into the IDE's terminal
- Run the market_screener.py and it will print out results into the terminal
